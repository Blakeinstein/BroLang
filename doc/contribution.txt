Contribution Plan:
For the final milestone, our team plans to work together to implement and test the Bro'Lang compiler and parse tree interpreter/runtime environment. We will divide the remaining work among ourselves, with each member taking on the following tasks:

Rishikesh: Implement the interpreter, including the evaluation of expressions and execution of statements.
Varun: Implement the lexer and parser, and handle error checking and reporting.
Krutik: Write and run automated tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the compiler and interpreter.

We will also collaborate closely to integrate our individual components and address any bugs or issues that arise. 



Contributions So Far:
Each team member has contributed equally to the project so far, with the following tasks completed:

Rishikesh: Wrote the grammar and designed the language features of Bro'Lang, and set up the project repository.
Varun: Helped refine the language design and wrote the initial version of the project proposal.
Krutik: Contributed to the language design discussions, provided feedback on the proposal, and wrote the finalized version of the project proposal.

We have also been meeting regularly to discuss progress and plan our next steps.
